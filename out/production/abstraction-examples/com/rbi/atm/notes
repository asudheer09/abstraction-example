Abstraction: hiding internal details and showing functionality.
in java we can achieve abstraction using interfaces and abstract classes.

what is an interface?
=====================
it is like requirement specification (features).
examples :

RBI---> ATM
===========
 balanceEnquiry()
 withDraw()
 moneyTransfer()
 deposit()

interface is a keyword used to create an interface.
when you create an interface all methods in interface should be public abstract.

public abstract void withDraw();
public abstract double balanceEnquiry();
 String moneyTransfer(int amt,string acc1,String acc2);

interface contains only abstract methods and constants.
constant is a fixed value, once we create a constant we never change its value.
ex : public static double PI=3.14;
ex : public static String NAME="sudheer";
constant names should be always capital: ex PI,NAME etc

syntax to create an interface:

interface interfaceName{
 //define abstract methods
 // constants


}

interface Atm{
 public abstract void balanceEnquiry();
 public abstract void withDraw();
 void moneyTransfer();
 void deposit();

}

class SbiAtm implements Atm{

void balanceEnquiry(){
sout("balance enquiry");
}

void withDraw(){
sout("balance withDraw");
}

void moneyTransfer(){
sout("moneyTransfer");
}

void deposit(){
sout("deposit");
}

A class cant extend more than one class. (multiple inheritance)
class A{
 m1()
}
class B{
m1()
}

class C extends A,B{
 m1() --> confusion for compiler which m1 it should call A's m1() or B's m1()
}

An interface can have multiple implementation classes.

If a class want to implement an interface then we have to use implements keyword.

interface Service{
//abstract methods
}

class ServiceImpl implements Service{

// override Service interface methods
}

A class can implement multiple interfaces at a time.

interface Service{


}

interface Atm{

}

class TestImpl implements Atm,Service{

}

concrete method:

concrete methods have implementations.
Example:

public void withDraw() {
        System.out.println("Axis withDraw");

    }

abstract method:
a method with abstract keyword and without any method body ({ }) or method decleration is called abstract method.
example
public abstract void balanceEnquiry();

we can define abstract methods inside class and also inside interface we can define.

abstract keyword we can apply for method and class only.

If we declare any abstract method inside class, then we have to declare that class as abstract.

we can declare a class as abstract even though it doesn't have any abstract methods.

For abstract classes we cant create object.
For interfaces also we cant create object.

java application  ---->JDBC API-------> any Data Base

JDBC API----> Java Database Connectivity Application Programming Interface.

JDBC API ---> contains interface and abstract classes.

java application ---------> insert/update/delete/select ------->Data Base

interface Dao{
  void addStudent(Student s);
  void findStudent(int sid);
}

class DaoImpl implements Dao{
ArrayList list= new ArrayList();

void addStudent(Student s){
  list.add(s);
}
